Sorting

Consider the following version of Bubble Sort:

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Track number of elements swapped during a single array traversal
    int numberOfSwaps = 0;

    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
        // Swap adjacent elements if they are in decreasing order
        if (a[j] > a[j + 1]) {
            swap(a[j], a[j + 1]);
            numberOfSwaps++;
        }
    }

    // If no elements were swapped during a traversal, array is sorted
    if (numberOfSwaps == 0) {
        break;
    }
}

Task
Given an array, a, of size n distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above.
Once sorted, print the following 3 lines:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement
where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement
where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

Example
a = [4, 3, 1, 2]

original a: 4 3 1 2
round 1  a: 3 1 2 4 swaps this round: 3
round 2  a: 1 2 3 4 swaps this round: 2
round 3  a: 1 2 3 4 swaps this round: 0
In the first round, the 4 is swapped at each of the 3 comparisons, ending in the last position. In the second round, the 3 is swapped at 2 of the 3 comparisons. Finally, in the third round, no swaps are made so the iterations stop. The output is the following:

Array is sorted in 5 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 4
Input Format
The first line contains an integer, n, the number of elements in array a.
The second line contains n space-separated integers that describe a[0], a[1], . . .a[n â€“ 1].

Constraints
2 <= n <= 600
1 <= a[i] <= 2 x10^6, where 0 <= i < n
Output Format
Print the following three lines of output:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement
where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement
where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
