Operators
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax
percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round
the result to the nearest integer.

Example
A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value  and return from the function.

int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax
int tip_percent: the tip percentage
int tax_percent: the tax percentage
